# Unit 08 Project 1 Homework: Professional Materials

If you are opting out of career services, this is _still a required assignment_. Part of being a web developer means being a part of a community. Having a place to share your projects is _necessary_ if you're applying for jobs, but is still _critical_ on your journey as a developer.
