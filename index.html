              <p>Hi! My name is Alex Tatum and I live in Lake Orion Michigan. I have been a Michigan resident my entire life! I attended Grand Valley State University for two years pursuing an Early and Elementary Education degree for teaching.
                  I then transfered over to Oakland University for another 4 years for the same degree. But as time wore on the teaching field no longer called to me as something I wanted to pursue for the rest of my life. 
              </p>
                <p>After putting a hold on school until I found what I really wanted to do with my future, I spent my time as a Nanny to a sweet little boy and then eventually at the job I am working now as a receptionist at a veterinary hospital.
                    I have worked there for over a  year now and have learned many amazing things while doing so. But I knew that I needed to find what I wanted to do as my career and I started to really dig in to my hobbies to see what might be possible.
                    I took a coding class back when I was in high school and I really loved everything that I learned and from there I had spent a few years trying to teach myself. I stopped when I went to college but never really forgot how much fun coding brought me. 
                    So during COVID I had a little extra time to research the things I would need to know or what I should to do obtain a career in the development field and it led me to Michigan State University's Coding Bootcamp. 
                    I hope this is the start to a very fufilling and exciting career ahead of me. 
                </p>
